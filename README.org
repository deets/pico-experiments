* Pico Rust Programming Example

A small test project to play around with Rust and it's PIOs.

It is designed to measure distance with a HC-SR04 and print
the results in cms via RTT.

** Setup

I'm using the Pico-as-Picoprobe setup, see https://reltech.substack.com/p/getting-started-with-rust-on-a-raspberry

To establish an OCD connection, run =./run-openocd.sh= in a shell.

** Compile and upload

Just the usual =cargo build= and then =cargo run=

Run these via GDB:

#+begin_src bash
monitor rp2040.core0 rtt setup 0x2003fbc0 0x30 "SEGGER RTT"
monitor rtt start
monitor rtt server start 3334 0
#+end_src

Run this to decode:
#+begin_src bash
nc localhost 3334 | ./target/debug/defmt-print -e /home/deets/projects/private/hc-sr04-experiments/target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/debug/hc-sr04-experiments
#+end_src
